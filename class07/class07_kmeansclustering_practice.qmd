Generate some example data for clustering.
tmp <- c(rnorm(30,-3),rnorm(30,3))
x < - cbind (x=tmp,y=rev(tmp))

```{r}

tmp <- c(rnorm(30,-3),rnorm(30,3))
x <- cbind (x=tmp,y=rev(tmp))
```


Use the `kmeans()` function setting k to 2 and nstart = 20
Inspect and print the results

kmeans(x, centers = number of clusters, nstart = number times to run) 

```{r}
kmeans(x, centers=2, nstart=20)
```
