Today we will analyze some data fro m538 about typical Halloween candy.

Our first job is t o go get the data and read it into R. 
```{r}
candy <- read.csv("candy-data.csv", row.names=1)
head(candy)
```
```{r}

```


>Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

Check the number of rows with `nrow()`
```{r}
nrow(candy)
ncol(candy)
```
There are 85 types of candy in this dataset. 

>Q. How many chocolate candy types are in this dataset? 

Check by summing up the values in the "chocolate" column
```{r}
sum(candy$chocolate)
```

There are 37 types of candy that are chocolate. 

>Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```
There are 38 types of candy that are fruity. 

##Data Exploration
There is a useful package that is helpful for first looking into a new dataset (skimr). We can see what it does to this dataset now.
#install.packages("skimr")
```{r}
library("skimr")

skim(candy)
```

>Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Milky Way", "winpercent"]
```
My favorite candy is Milky Way, and its winpercent value is 73.09956%

>Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", "winpercent"]
```
The winpercent value for Kit Kat is 76.7686%

>Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", "winpercent"]
```
The winpercent value for Tootsie Rolls is 49.6535%


>Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

Yes, the "winpercent" variable is on a different scale from most of the other variables. 

>Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

They represent whether the candy is (1) or is not (0) chocolate.

>Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent)
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes (winpercent) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=8) 
  
```

>Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

The distribution of winpercent values is not symmetrical; it is left-skewed towards the lower (< 50%) values. 

>Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

The center of the distribution is below 50%. 

>Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

- First, find all chocolate candy (subset), so that the table is just chocolate 
- Get their winpercent values 
- Summarize these values into one metric 

```{r}
choc.inds <- as.logical(candy$chocolate)
choc.mean <- mean(candy[choc.inds,]$winpercent)
```
```{r}
fruity.inds <- as.logical(candy$fruity)
fruit.mean <- mean(candy[fruity.inds,]$winpercent)
```
Chocolate candy is more popular at 60.9% than fruity candy at 44%. 


>Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

We can use T-test on R. 

```{r}
t.test(candy[fruity.inds,]$winpercent, candy[choc.inds,]$winpercent)
```
The p-value is 2.871e-08, indicating that these results are different in a statistically significant manner. 

>Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

Try using `order`, which sorts on/reorders multiple variables. It also allows permutations to be applied to the data, so that all data is ordered by whatever parameter is selected. 
```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds, ])
```
Nik L Nip, Boston Baked Beans, Chiclets, Super Bubble, and Jawbusters are the least liked candies. 


>Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
tail(candy[inds, ])
```
Reese's PB cups, Reese's miniatures, Twix, Kit Kat, Snickers are the top 5. 

>Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```


>Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x="Matchup Win Percent", y=NULL)

ggsave("barplot1.png", height=10, width=7)
```
We can insert any image using markdown syntax. This is ! followed by square brackets and then normal brackets. 

Put the file name in the normal brackets.

![](barplot1.png) 


We can also add some color. 

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent), color=chocolate) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x="Matchup Win Percent", y=NULL)
```
We need to make our own color vector with the colors we like. 

```{r}
my_cols <- rep("darkgrey", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "pink"
```
```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent), fill=my_cols) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x="Matchup Win Percent", y=NULL)

ggsave("barplot2.png", height=10, width=7)

```
Why did the graph turn red originally? Because aesthetic mapping from data is used, it'll try to match the data to the X and Y axes data. It's matching the first color on the palette (red). So, do not use the aesthetics to set the color; use it to the geometry. 

![This is some caption text](barplot2.png){#fig-bar}
As shown in {@fig-bar} there are some ugly colors to pick from in R.

>Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Sixlets is the lowest ranked chocolate candy. 

>Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starbursts are the highest ranked fruity candy. 

>Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Let's make a plot of winpercent vs pricepercent. The original idea with this 538 plot was to show you the best candy to get for your money.

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text(col=my_cols)
```
These labels are terrible. Get ggrepel package.

```{r}
library(ggrepel)
```

```{r}

my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "red"

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 8) 
  
```



>Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

Nik L Nip, Ring Pop, Nestle Smarties, Mr Good Bar, and Hershey's Milk Chocolate are the most expensive. Nik L Nip is the least popular. 

##Explore the correlation structure in candy data.

We will calcualte Pearson correlation values. 
```{r}
cij <- cor(candy)
#Shows the pairwise correlation between each parameter. 
```
Let's install and load corrplot. 

```{r}
library(corrplot)
corrplot(cij)
```
This is the type of data that PCA takes advantage of. Let's see how PCA captures this correlation structure in an informative way. 

>Q21. Make a barplot again with geom_col() this time using pricepercent and then improve this step by step, first ordering the x-axis by value and finally making a so called “dot chat” or “lollipop” chart by swapping geom_col() for geom_point() + geom_segment().

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(pricepercent) +
  geom_bar()
  
```



##PCA 
The main function is called `prcomp`. We will need to scale. 
>Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Chocolate and fruit are anti-correlated. 

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=TRUE)
```

```{r}
summary(pca)
```
```{r}
pc.results <- as.data.frame(pca$x)
```

```{r}
ggplot(pc.results) + 
   aes(x=PC1, y=PC2) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols) 
```
Note that chocolate is separated from fruit. 

What does PC1 really caputure? Do a loadings plot.

```{r}
ggplot(pc.results) + 
   aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, label=rownames(pc.results)) +
   geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(size = 2, max.overlaps = 8)
```


```{r}
pc.loadings <- as.data.frame(pca$rotation)

ggplot(pc.loadings) +
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(pc.loadings), PC1)) +
  geom_col()
```
Explains why things are plotted the way they are; these are the things that factored and are reflected by PC1. 

>Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Fruit and pluribus are correlated. 


>Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

"Fruit", "pluribus", and "hard" are the variables picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction.
